/**
 * Battery health estimate for jdn.
 *
 * The PM8916 fuel gauge is voltage-mode with no coulomb counter, so this tablet cannot
 * measure its battery's real full capacity the way a Pixel does. What it can give is a real
 * charge-cycle count: the vm-bms adds up every rise in charge and counts a cycle per 100 %
 * (kernel "qcom,batt-aging-comp"), keeps it in the PMIC, and the bq24296m driver passes it to
 * the health HAL, so it arrives here as BatteryManager.EXTRA_CYCLE_COUNT.
 *
 * Capacity = 100 % - calendar wear - cycle wear:
 *  - calendar wear grows with the square root of the battery's age (the passivation layer
 *    on the anode grows that way), from the month the user says the battery was new;
 *  - cycle wear is close to linear in full cycles: the cycles the tablet counted, plus, for
 *    the time before it counted, cycles estimated from how often the user says it was
 *    charged.
 * The constants come from kiwi (Honor 5X), where they were fitted to typical LiCoO2 cells
 * like its ATL HB396481EBC: about 90 % after a year of daily use and about 84 % after 500
 * cycles over 20 months. There is no such data for this tablet's HB3080G1EBW, so they are
 * kept as they are. It is an estimate and the page says so.
